Hey, my name is Rebecca and I'm new to developing.
I'm just browsing code right now and trying to learn how a protocol like nostr works.
I am doing it mainly because its interesting to me- I like that I can remain anonymous and don't have to include a stupid email when signing up. 
Bitcoin is great too. 
I have a lot to learn. 
Other projects that interest me are Wikipedia and audiobook apps like Audible. 
AI is cool too, LLMS and all that. 
I will probably have to read a lots of your guys's code before ever doing anything. 
Cheers.
